 <h1>What is HTML??</h1>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML file is structured. This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia on a webpage.</p>
<p>
HTML is a formal recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is generally adhered to by all major web browsers, including both desktop and mobile web browsers. HTML5 is the latest version of the specification.</p>

<!-- <p>This is the simple example of this 
    <!DOCTYPE>  
<html>  
<head>  
<title>Web page title</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
<h1>Write Your First Heading</h1>  
<p>Write Your First Paragraph.</p>  
</body>  
</html> -->

<h2>How it Works?</h2>

<p>HTML is a text file containing specific syntax, file and naming conventions that show the computer and the web server that it is in HTML and should be read as such. By applying these HTML conventions to a text file in virtually any text editor, a user can write and design a basic webpage, and then upload it to the internet.
</p>

<p>
The most basic of HTML conventions is the inclusion of a document type declaration at the beginning of the text file. This always comes first in the document, because it is the piece that affirmatively informs a computer that this is an HTML file. The document header typically looks like this: <!DOCTYPE html>. It should always be written that way, without any content inside it or breaking it up. Any content that comes before this declaration will not be recognized as HTML by a computer.
</p>

<p>
 The other critical requirement for creating an HTML file is saving it with a .html file extension. Whereas the doctype declaration signals HTML to the computer from the inside of the file, the file extension signals HTML to the computer from the outside of the file. By having both, a computer can tell that it's an HTML file whether it's reading the file or not. This becomes especially important when uploading the files to the web, because the web server needs to know what to do with the files before it can send them to a client computer for the inner contents to be read.
</p>

<h2>Basic of HTML</h2>

<p>Using HTML, a text file is further marked up with additional text describing how the document should be displayed. To keep the markup separate from the actual content of the HTML file, there is a special, distinguishing HTML syntax that is used. These special components are known as HTML tags. The tags can contain name-value pairs known as attributes, and a piece of content that is enclosed within a tag is referred to as an HTML element.
</p>
<p>
HTML elements always have opening tags, content in the middle and closing tags. Attributes can provide additional information about the element and are included in the opening tag. Elements can be described in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Block-level elements start on a new line in the document and take up their own space. Examples of these elements include headings and paragraph tags.</li>

    <li>Inline elements do not start on a new line in the document and only take up necessary space. These elements usually format the contents of block-level elements. Examples of inline elements include hyperlinks and text format tags.</li>   
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Commonly used HTML tags</h2>

<p>HTML tags dictate the overall structure of a page and how the elements within them will be displayed in the browser. Commonly used HTML tags include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>h1 which describes a top-level heading.</li>
    <li>h2 which describes a second-level heading.</li>
    <!-- Whts to put <> brackets -->
    <li>p which describes a paragraph.</li> 
    <li>table which describes tabular data.</li>
    <li>ol which describes an ordered list of information.</li>
    <li>ul which describes an unordered list of information.</li>
    <li>As mentioned, there are opening and closing tags that surround the content they are augmenting. An opening tag looks like this: <p>A closing tag is the same but contains a backslash in it to indicate that it's the end of the given HTML element. Closing tags look like this: </p></li>
</ul>
