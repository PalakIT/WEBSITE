    <h2>What is Java Script</h2>
    <p>avaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
    <p>JavaScript has evolved over the past 25 years to become a versatile and accessible programming language for working with web browsers. Developers use JavaScript to build complex interactive websites and browser games, and to connect servers to websites and web applications. Because of this versatility, it's easy to see why this language is the most commonly used programming language in the world</p>
    <h2>Creating Interactive Websites</h2>
    <p>JavaScript makes web pages dynamic. Before JavaScript, web pages were built only with HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are only capable of creating static pages that can be styled but not interactive aside from hyperlinks. Some of the most popular websites are built with JavaScript, including Google, YouTube, and Facebook.</p>

    JavaScript allows developers to implement features like:
    <ul>
        <li>Showing and hiding menus or information</li>
        <li>Adding hover effects</li>
        <li>Creating image galleries in a carousel format</li>
        <li>Zooming in or zooming out on an image</li>
        <li>Playing audio or video on a web page</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Building Applications</h2>
    <p>With JavaScript’s extensive collection of frameworks, developers can efficiently build apps for mobile and web. Frameworks are libraries of pre-written JavaScript code that developers use for standard features. You can think of a JavaScript framework like a blueprint.

    The most popular JavaScript application frameworks are:
    <ul>
        <li>React: a collection of JavaScript created to build user interfaces for web applications.</li>
        <li>React Native: a collection that allows developers to build mobile apps with JavaScript</li>
        <li>Node.js: a collection that enables two-way communications with servers for exchanging data.</li>

    </ul>

    Facebook built React and React Native, which are currently powering some of the world’s most powerful social media applications. React is used by websites like Uber, Pinterest, Netflix, Instagram, Amazon, Twitter, Udemy, and more. Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Words with Friends, Skype, Pinterest, Discord, Tesla, and Uber Eats 
    </p>
    <h2>Why do we Need JavaScript?</h2>
    
    <p>Whether you plan to specialize in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development, JavaScript is a crucial programming language for any web developer. Without JavaScript, we wouldn’t have the dynamic and interactive web pages that have become the standard user experience we all know, love, and rely on</p>
